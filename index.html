Why Homeowners Hire Me
Save Money
Most homeowners overpay because of missing scope or inflated allowances. I help you catch it before you commit.
Reduce Risk
Identify red flags, unrealistic timelines, and change‑order traps that derail projects.
Less Stress
Make confident decisions with a trusted advisor on your side — not a contractor trying to sell you something.
FAQ
Do you work on site?
No. This is an advisory service conducted by phone/Zoom and email. If you need on‑site representation, ask and I can recommend options.
Are you available across the DFW metro?
Yes — Dallas, Fort Worth, and surrounding communities.
What if I don’t have multiple bids yet?
That’s okay. I can help you scope the job and prepare questions to get apples‑to‑apples quotes.
Is this legal advice?
No. I provide construction experience and practical guidance, not legal or engineering advice.
